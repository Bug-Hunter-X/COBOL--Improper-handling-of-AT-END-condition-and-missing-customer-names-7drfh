This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: the improper handling of the AT END condition in READ statements.  The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.cob` file provides the corrected code.  The issue arises when attempting to process a customer record that does not exist within the `CUSTOMER-FILE`.  The solution ensures the program handles this scenario gracefully without causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior.  The solution also gracefully handles missing customer names.
